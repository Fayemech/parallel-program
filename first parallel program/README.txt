    After decompress it, goes in to the file folder and run make. I already test it, makefile works well. If it doesn't work, it can also be done with "gcc nbar.c -o n" then ./n x will work. x should be the number of the PE you want.

    After run this program it will show all theâ€œI am PE" message before any of the "I am still PE" message.
